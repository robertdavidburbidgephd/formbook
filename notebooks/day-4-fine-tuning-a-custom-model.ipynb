    "# Day 4 - Fine tuning a custom model\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome back to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will use the Gemini API to fine-tune a custom, task-specific model. Fine-tuning can be used for a variety of tasks from classic NLP problems like entity extraction or summarisation, to creative tasks like stylised generation. You will fine-tune a model to classify the category a piece of text (a newsgroup post) into the category it belongs to (the newsgroup name).\n",
    "\n",
    "This codelab walks you tuning a model with the API. [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tune) also supports creating new tuned models directly in the web UI, allowing you to quickly create and monitor models using data from Google Sheets, Drive or your own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We recommend doing this codelab first today. There may be a period of waiting while the model tunes, so if you start with this one, you can try the other codelab while you wait."

      "\n",
      "**The Bonneville Lineup:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Base:**  This was the most basic model, with standard features like cloth upholstery, a 3.8L V6 engine, and a 4-speed automatic transmission. \n",
      "* **LE (Luxury Edition):** This offered more upscale interior features like velour upholstery, power windows and locks, and a premium sound system. \n",
      "* **SE (Sport Edition):** This model was focused on performance and handling. It featured a larger 5.0L V8 engine,  sport suspension, and a unique appearance package.\n",
      "* **LSE (Luxury Sport Edition):** This combined the luxury of the LE with the performance of the SE, offering features like leather upholstery, a sunroof, and a more powerful V8. \n",
      "* **SSE (Special Sport Edition):** This was the top-of-the-line model. It came with a 5.0L V8 with a higher horsepower output, special performance-oriented features, and a more distinctive interior and exterior styling.\n",
      "* **SSEi (Special Sport Edition with Injection):** This was a rare model with a fuel-injected 5.0L V8, offering slightly better performance and fuel economy than the non-injected SSE.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Value and Demand:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Book Value:** The exact book value of a 1989 Bonneville will depend on the specific model, mileage, condition, and location. You can check online resources like Kelley Blue Book (KBB) or Edmunds to get an estimate.\n",
      "* **Negotiation Room:**  As with any used car, you can usually negotiate a price below book value, especially if you're willing to shop around and find a seller motivated to sell.\n",
      "* **Seasonal Variations:**  While it's true that springtime can be a good time to buy used cars, it's not a hard-and-fast rule. The best time to buy depends on local market conditions and individual seller motivations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finding a Good Deal:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Research:**  Know the fair market value of the Bonneville models you're interested in. \n",
      "2. **Inspect Thoroughly:** Have any potential purchase inspected by a mechanic to ensure it's in good condition.\n",
      "3. **Negotiate:** Don't be afraid to negotiate the price. \n",
      "4. **Be Patient:** Take your time, and don't settle for the first car you see. Shop around and find the best deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Parts Availability:** Although the Bonneville was popular, it's an older car now. Make sure to check the availability of parts for maintenance and repair.\n",
      "* **Reliability:** Some reports suggest that the 1988-89 Bonnevilles can be prone to certain issues, especially with the 5.0L V8 engine. Research these potential problems before you buy.\n",
